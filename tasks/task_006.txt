   - Added support for filtering directory listings with patterns or FileFilter

3. Batch Directory Operations:
   - Added makeDirectories(List<String>) for creating multiple directories in one operation
   - Improved makeDirectories(String) method with better path handling for creating nested directory structures

4. Directory Structure Management:
   - Implemented copyDirectoryStructure() to copy entire directory trees with or without files
   - Enhanced deleteDirectory() with better error handling and recursive capabilities

5. Directory Attributes:
   - Added getFileInfo() and getAttributes() methods to retrieve comprehensive directory metadata
   - Implemented getDirectorySize() to calculate total size of directory contents

6. Enhanced Error Handling:
   - Added additional error types to FTPOperationException for directory-specific errors
   - Implemented proper connection pool management with automatic connection recovery

The directory manipulation functionality now provides a complete, robust API for working with directories on FTP servers with proper error handling, connection pooling, and comprehensive operations.

## 5. Implement File Attribute Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Create functionality to get and set file attributes on an FTP server
### Details:
Implement methods for retrieving and modifying file attributes such as permissions, timestamps, and ownership. Handle server-specific attribute formats and commands. Include support for standard FTP attribute commands and extended commands where available.
<info added on 2025-05-20T09:00:09.424Z>
Implemented comprehensive file attribute handling functionality with the following features:

1. Retrieving File/Directory Attributes:
   - Enhanced getModificationTime() to handle both files and directories
   - Implemented getFileInfo() to retrieve detailed file information objects
   - Created getAttributes() to provide a structured map of all file attributes

2. Setting Permissions:
   - Implemented setPermissions() to modify file/directory permissions using:
     - Octal permission format (e.g., "755")
     - Individual permission flags (userRead, userWrite, etc.)
   - Proper handling of server-specific SITE CHMOD commands

3. Timestamp Manipulation:
   - Added setModificationTime() to change file timestamps using:
     - String format (YYYYMMDDhhmmss)
     - Calendar objects for easier Java integration

4. Batch Attribute Operations:
   - Implemented setAttributes() to modify multiple attributes in a single operation
   - Proper handling of mixed attribute types and formats

5. Server Capability Detection:
   - Added supportsFeature() to detect which attribute operations are supported
   - Implemented getSupportedFeatures() to list all available server features
   - Graceful fallback handling when servers don't support specific commands

6. Robust Error Handling:

## 6. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Create a robust error handling system for all FTP operations
### Details:
Implement a comprehensive error handling system that properly categorizes and reports FTP errors. Include recovery strategies for common failure scenarios such as connection drops, timeouts, and permission issues. Create meaningful exception hierarchies and ensure all operations properly propagate and handle errors.
<info added on 2025-05-20T09:10:18.510Z>
Implemented a comprehensive error handling system for FTP operations with the following features:

1. Enhanced Exception Hierarchy:
   - Specialized exceptions for different error types (FTPConnectionException, FTPTransferException, FTPFileOperationException)
   - Detailed error information including error type, path, reply code, and retry status
   - Built-in error interpretation and classification of FTP reply codes

2. Auto-Recovery with Retry Mechanism:
   - Smart retry logic based on error recoverability classification
   - Configurable retry counts and delays for different error types
   - Progress tracking between retry attempts
   - Enhanced logging during retry operations

3. Circuit Breaker Pattern:
   - Implemented FTPCircuitBreaker to prevent cascading failures
   - Automatic state transitions (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF-OPEN) based on failure patterns
   - Separate circuit breakers for different operation types (connections, transfers, file operations)
   - Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts

4. Comprehensive Error Metrics:
   - Implemented FTPErrorMetrics for collecting and analyzing error patterns
   - Tracking of error types, reply codes, and operation success/failure rates
   - Support for error pattern analysis and reporting

5. Error Management Facade:
   - Created FTPErrorManager to orchestrate all error handling components
   - Seamless integration of retry, circuit breaker, and metrics collection
   - Context-aware error handling based on operation type

6. Decorator Pattern Implementation:
   - Developed FTPOperationsWithErrorHandling as a decorator for the base FTPOperations
   - Non-invasive enhancement of existing code with advanced error handling
   - Factory pattern (FTPOperationsFactory) for easy creation of operations with appropriate error handling

This comprehensive error handling system provides robust operation with automatic recovery from transient failures, protection against cascading failures, and detailed error metrics for monitoring and analysis.
