      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Basic FTP Connection Controller into specific subtasks covering class structure, property descriptors, validation logic, and lifecycle methods.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a foundation class with moderate complexity. It requires implementing interfaces, defining property descriptors, validation logic, and service lifecycle methods. The code structure is already well-defined but needs to be implemented with proper error handling and testing. Breaking it into 4 subtasks would allow focus on class structure, property management, validation, and lifecycle methods separately."
