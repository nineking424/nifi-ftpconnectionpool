# FTP Connection Pool Project Summary

## Project Overview

The FTP Connection Pool project for Apache NiFi provides a robust, persistent connection pooling service for FTP operations. This service significantly improves performance and reliability when working with FTP servers by maintaining and reusing connections rather than establishing new connections for each operation.

   - Created property descriptor system
   - Implemented validation logic
   - Developed service lifecycle methods

2. **Connection Configuration**
   - Implemented comprehensive configuration options
   - Created secure credential handling
   - Built configuration object model
   - Added validation for all parameters

3. **Single Connection Management**
   - Built connection initialization and testing
   - Implemented state tracking
   - Added reconnection logic
   - Created error handling mechanisms

4. **Connection Pool**
   - Implemented robust thread-safe pool
   - Created connection validation policies
   - Added metrics collection
   - Built graceful shutdown

5. **Connection Health Management**
   - Created health monitoring system
   - Implemented automatic recovery
   - Added proactive health checks

6. **Basic FTP Operations**
   - Implemented directory listing
   - Added file upload/download
   - Created directory manipulation
   - Built attribute handling

7. **Advanced Configuration**
   - Added buffer size options
   - Implemented transfer mode selection
   - Created encoding configuration
   - Added proxy support
   - Implemented SSL/TLS options

8. **Error Management and Recovery**
   - Implemented retry mechanisms
   - Created recovery strategies
   - Added circuit breaker pattern
   - Built comprehensive error handling
   - Added bulletin reporting

9. **Metrics Collection and Monitoring**
   - Created connection statistics
   - Implemented performance metrics
   - Added throughput measurements
   - Built JMX metrics exposure
   - Implemented bulletin reporting

10. **NiFi Processor Integration**
    - Created ListFTP processor
    - Implemented GetFTP processor
    - Built PutFTP processor
    - Added service discovery
    - Created comprehensive documentation
